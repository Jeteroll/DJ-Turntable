				<h1><a name="mystory">My Story</a></h1>
				<p>
					I grew up with a very musical family. My father played the 
					saxophone with a "band of buddies" from his college days, 
					and he is now the local high schol band teache. My mother 
					is the singer in the family, and she is a regular lead 
					performer in musicals with our community theater. Needless 
					to say, my three siblings and I all took music lessons. But 
					even though I was the one who never could settle on a favorite 
					instrument, I'm the only one who went into the music business! 
					<br>
					Early on, music became my thing. I could name any song on 
					the radio and tell you not only who was singing it, but also 
					who wrote it and when. At my senior prom, I was at the turntable 
					mare than I was on the dance floor.
					<br>
					During college, I supplemented my income by DJ-ing fraternity- 
					and sorority- sponsored parties and other campus events. 
					Eventually I landed a job with a radio station. That was cool 
					but I missed being part of all the action and fun that people 
					were having at a party rocking with music. Let's face it, being 
					a DJ is the closest thing to being a rockstar without having to 
					play an instrument!
					<br>
					So, I started DJ Turntable, and I haven't stopped spinning since 
					I love what I do and so will you. 
					<br>
